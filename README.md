Sunday Shows Guest List
=======================

Since the beginning of 2009, more than 1,500 people have appeared on five Sunday news and political talk shows: “Meet the Press,” “Face the Nation,” “This Week,” “Fox News Sunday” and “State of the Union.” Many are familiar faces in Washington, where lawmakers, consultants and pundits routinely sound off on the week's news, while others come from the worlds of entertainment and sports. [Researchers at American University](http://www.american.edu/spa/wpi/sunday-morning-monitor.cfm) have collected more than 9,000 appearances during that time. The Upshot added to the original spreadsheet and standardized the names. The [interactive graphic](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/09/05/upshot/05up-sundayguests.html) does not display network employees or regular guests on contract, but the source data includes all guests.
